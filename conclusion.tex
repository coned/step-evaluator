\section{Conclusion}

This paper develops an interactive stepper for \Hazel, hence, language environment with holes. It uses the $\mathtt{paused}$ judgement to detect the unnecessary situation so that the stepper will stop over the paused expression. Also, we develop a simple algorithm for decomposition that can find all subexpressions which need to evaluate. We use the contextual dynamics to progress the expression for stepper. This result may be useful for debugging or educational purpose. We plan to evaluate these tools in an educational setting in the future.
