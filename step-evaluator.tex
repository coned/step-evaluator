% \begin{abstract}
%   A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
%   article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
%   or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
%   article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
%   as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
%   preparation of the documentation of their work.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
% \item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
% \end{itemize}

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
% \begin{acks}
% To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
% \end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{sample-base}

%%
%% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
